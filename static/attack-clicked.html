        <p>You've fallen for a phishing attack and clicked on an unsafe link.</p>

        <p>
          Phishing emails often appear legitimate but aim to deceive you into sharing sensitive information
          or clicking malicious links. One way to spot them is by carefully examining the sender's email
          address. Check for misspellings or unusual domains that don't match the organization they claim
          to represent. Additionally, watch out for urgent requests for personal or financial information,
          especially if they threaten consequences for not complying quickly. Legitimate companies typically
          won't ask for sensitive information via email.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another red flag is poorly written or overly generic content. Phishing emails often contain
          grammatical errors, vague greetings, or generic language that doesn't match the usual tone of
          communication from the supposed sender. Be cautious of unexpected attachments or links, especially
          if they prompt you to log in to an account or provide personal details. When in doubt, contact the
          organization directly through their official website or customer service channels to verify the
          authenticity of the email.
